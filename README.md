This website is for the OctoMuyThai gym and is a gym training students in the Thailand martial art of Muy Thai. The website is designed to work across a range of platforms from desktop to mobile to allow easy accessiblity for current and new students alike as well as those interested casually in the art of Muy Thai.

## User experience

### Strategy Plane

The goal of the website for the business owner of the gym is to encourage new students to take up and practice the martial art of Muy Thai at the OctoMuyThai gym. 

The goal for visitors at the site will be to understand the services provided by the gym, find out the price of membership and be able to sign up and become a member of the gym.

### Scope Plane

The main feature is a landing page showcasing the gym and it's branded and the benefits of joining. This will achieve the goal of presenting why it would be a good idea to become a member of the gym.

The additional features will be pages presenting Muy Thai techniques, showing the timetable for classes at the gym, presenting the price of gym membership and a sign up page so that visitors to the site can join the gym. This achieves the goal of helping site visitors understanding the services provided by the gym, the price of membership and enabling new students to sign up.

### Structure Plane

Main structure will be the landing page presenting the brand and benefits of joining as a member at OctoMuyThai.

A seperate page each for description and tutorial of Muy Thai techniques, timetable and membership pricing and finally sign up page and detailed description of where and how to find the gym.

The logic being that description of techniques serves the purpose of showcasing the martial art to students so should have a dedicated page. Then, a key part of knowing whether you want to join the gym is to know the timing of classes and the pricing of membership and one-off classes so it makes sense from an user experience perspective to group this together. Lastly, is the sign up page where site visitors can sign up for gym membership and it is assumed at this stage from the previous pages the user has determined and finalised the decision on whether to join or not and therefore would want to sign up and then also know exactly how to find the gym as a final confirmation of information in order to make the decision to join.

### Skeleton Plane

The header of the page will contain the name of the gym, tagline and logo. Within the header, there will also be a navigation bar to the different pages of the site. The main content will then follow with the appropriate information clearly and concisely presented in each page as per the structure plane. There will then be a footer which contains the address of the gym, social media links and then another navigation bar to save users having to scroll back up to the very top of the page in order to navigate to different pages of the site.

### Surface Plane

#### Colour scheme
The main colour scheme is blue and orange, specifically #37A3C8 and #C85C37. Canva's color wheel was utilisied in order to determine this colour scheme and to ensure that it was complementary.

#### Typography
The font used is Nunito from Google Fonts.

#### Imagery
The imagery is vital especially with the logo which incorporates the eight limbs philosophy of Muy Thai and matches with the colour scheme used. Background images were used in some instances with the orange background colour to complement the content.

## Features
* Responsive and functional on all device sizes
* Interactive

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3

## Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used
1. Bootstrap 4.5.2 - Bootstrap was used to assist with the styling and responsiveness of the website
2. Hover.css - Hover.css was used on the navigation bar to perform a float animation as the mouse hovers over each navigation item.
3. Google Fonts - Google fonts was used to import the Cairo and BioRhyme fonts into the style.css file which is used through the pages in this project.
4. Font Awesome - Font awesome was used for the social media links in the footer of the pages of the project.
5. Git - Git was used for version control by utilising the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and push to Github.
6. Github - Github was used to store the project code and to host and display the project in Github Pages.
7. Balsamiq - Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes to provide a guide for the design.

## Testing
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator were used to validate every page of the project to avoid any syntax errors.

* W3C Markup Validator - frameborder attribute in the iframe element deemed obselete thus subsequently removed - no other errors or warnings were flagged.
* W3C CSS Validator - px was used when giving a value for font-weight and isn't valid thus was subsequently corrected - no other errors or warnings were flagged.

## Further Testing
* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox.
* The Website was tested on laptop, Iphone and Samsung Galaxy S8.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure all links across pages are working correctly.
* A friend, who is a fullstack developer, was asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs or user experience issues.

## Fixed Bugs/Issues
* I had an issue whereby the rows under the main heading row were sticking out making the website look uneven. I finally figured out is that those other rows in the header required the Bootstrap class "no-gutters" as well as the row where the main title was on.
* There was issue with images being used as backgrounds for various divs and as a result being cut-off in an unaesthetic way. I re-sized the images and amended the margins in the content to ensure the background images now show in a more aesthetic way.
* I had an issue centering the logo image and resolved this by using the class in the col div and giving it text-align: center to ensure that anything placed within it is centered i.e. the logo image.
* While testing the Website on Iphone using the Safari browser saw that my map picture on the sign up page was sticking out to the right of everything else on the page. I removed the margin-left styling from the css and instead used a width styling of 100% to resolve this.

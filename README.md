This website is for the OctoMuyThai gym and is a gym training students in the Thailand martial art of Muy Thai. The website is designed to work across a range of platforms from desktop to mobile to allow easy accessiblity for current and new students alike as well as those interested casually in the art of Muy Thai.

## User experience

### Strategy Plane

The goal of the website for the business owner of the gym is to encourage new students to take up and practice the martial art of Muy Thai at the OctoMuyThai gym. 

The goal for visitors at the site will be to understand the services provided by the gym, find out the price of membership and be able to sign up and become a member of the gym.

### Scope Plane

The main feature is a landing page showcasing the gym and it's branded and the benefits of joining. This will achieve the goal of presenting why it would be a good idea to become a member of the gym.

The additional features will be pages presenting Muy Thai techniques, showing the timetable for classes at the gym, presenting the price of gym membership and a sign up page so that visitors to the site can join the gym. This achieves the goal of helping site visitors understanding the services provided by the gym, the price of membership and enabling new students to sign up.

### Structure Plane

Main structure will be the landing page presenting the brand and benefits of joining as a member at OctoMuyThai.

A seperate page each for description and tutorial of Muy Thai techniques, timetable and membership pricing and finally sign up page and detailed description of where and how to find the gym.

The logic being that description of techniques serves the purpose of showcasing the martial art to students so should have a dedicated page. Then, a key part of knowing whether you want to join the gym is to know the timing of classes and the pricing of membership and one-off classes so it makes sense from an user experience perspective to group this together. Lastly, is the sign up page where site visitors can sign up for gym membership and it is assumed at this stage from the previous pages the user has determined and finalised the decision on whether to join or not and therefore would want to sign up and then also know exactly how to find the gym as a final confirmation of information in order to make the decision to join.

### Skeleton Plane

The header of the page will contain the name of the gym, tagline and logo. Within the header, there will also be a navigation bar to the different pages of the site. The main content will then follow with the appropriate information clearly and concisely presented in each page as per the structure plane. There will then be a footer which contains the address of the gym, social media links and then another navigation bar to save users having to scroll back up to the very top of the page in order to navigate to different pages of the site.

### Surface Plane

#### Colour scheme
The main colour scheme is blue and orange, specifically #37A3C8 and #C85C37. Canva's color wheel was utilisied in order to determine this colour scheme and to ensure that it was complementary.

#### Typography
The font used is Nunito from Google Fonts.

#### Imagery
The imagery is vital especially with the logo which incorporates the eight limbs philosophy of Muy Thai and matches with the colour scheme used. Background images were used in some instances with the orange background colour to complement the content.

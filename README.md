This website is for the OctoMuyThai gym and is a gym training students in the Thailand martial art of Muy Thai. The website is designed to work across a range of platforms from desktop to mobile to allow easy accessiblity for current and new students alike as well as those interested casually in the art of Muy Thai.

## User experience

### User Stories
* As a site user, I want to be able to easily navigate to other pages on the website to access specific information.
* As a site user, I want to know the name of the gym.
* As an owner of the site, I want visitors to know the name of the gym and what we offer.
* As a site user, I want to know why I should join this gym.
* As a site user, I want to be able to see any Muy Thai techniques I'm interested in learning.
* As a site user, I want to know the timing of the classes at the gym.
* As a site user, I want to know the price of membership at the gym.
* As a site user, I want to be able to join the gym.
* As an owner of the site, I want visitors to the site to be able to join the gym.
* As a site user, I want to find directions to get to the gym.

### Strategy Plane

The goal of the website for the business owner of the gym is to encourage new students to take up and practice the martial art of Muy Thai at the OctoMuyThai gym. 

The goal for visitors at the site will be to understand the services provided by the gym, find out the price of membership and be able to sign up and become a member of the gym.

### Scope Plane

The main feature is a landing page showcasing the gym and it's branded and the benefits of joining. This will achieve the goal of presenting why it would be a good idea to become a member of the gym.

The additional features will be pages presenting Muy Thai techniques, showing the timetable for classes at the gym, presenting the price of gym membership and a sign up page so that visitors to the site can join the gym. This achieves the goal of helping site visitors understanding the services provided by the gym, the price of membership and enabling new students to sign up.

### Structure Plane

Main structure will be the landing page presenting the brand and benefits of joining as a member at OctoMuyThai.

A seperate page each for description and tutorial of Muy Thai techniques, timetable and membership pricing and finally sign up page and detailed description of where and how to find the gym.

The logic being that description of techniques serves the purpose of showcasing the martial art to students so should have a dedicated page. Then, a key part of knowing whether you want to join the gym is to know the timing of classes and the pricing of membership and one-off classes so it makes sense from an user experience perspective to group this together. Lastly, is the sign up page where site visitors can sign up for gym membership and it is assumed at this stage from the previous pages the user has determined and finalised the decision on whether to join or not and therefore would want to sign up and then also know exactly how to find the gym as a final confirmation of information in order to make the decision to join.

### Skeleton Plane

The header of the page will contain the name of the gym, tagline and logo. Within the header, there will also be a navigation bar to the different pages of the site. The main content will then follow with the appropriate information clearly and concisely presented in each page as per the structure plane. There will then be a footer which contains the address of the gym, social media links and then another navigation bar to save users having to scroll back up to the very top of the page in order to navigate to different pages of the site.

### Surface Plane

#### Colour scheme
The main colour scheme is blue and orange, specifically #37A3C8 and #C85C37 with white text. Canva's color wheel was utilisied in order to determine this colour scheme and to ensure that it was complementary.

#### Typography
The font used is Nunito from Google Fonts.

#### Imagery
The imagery is vital especially with the logo which incorporates the eight limbs philosophy of Muy Thai and matches with the colour scheme used. Background images were used in some instances with the orange background colour to complement the content.

## User Stories Testing
1. As a site user, I want to be able to easily navigate to other pages on the website to access specific information.
* On the home page, I clicked on the header navigation bar on the Techniques heading which took me to the Techniques page. I then clicked on the logo which took me back to the Home page, from there I clicked on the Timetable heading in the header navigation bar which took me to the Timetable page. Again I clicked on the logo on the Timetable page which took me back to the Home page. Finally, I clicked on the Sign Up heading on the header navigation bar which took me to the Sign Up page and clicked on the logo from there which took me back to the Home page.
This process was repeated using the navigation headings in the footer following the same path Home page --> Techniques page --> Home page --> Timetable page --> Home page --> Sign Up page --> Home page.
Both those processes were replicated but this time using the Techniques page as the starting point testing both the links in the navigation headings in both the header and the footer. Finally this process was repeated twice over with the Timetable page as the starting page and then lastly the Sign Up page as the starting page thus ensuring all links are working on all pages.
2. As a site user, I want to know the name of the gym.
* When the Home page loads, straight away you see the OctoMuyThai name straight away clear at the top of the page making you aware of the name of the gym. This is replicated across all pages of the website as I use the navigation headings to go through to the Techniques, Timetable and Sign Up pages.
3. As an owner of the site, I want visitors to know the name of the gym and what we offer.
* When the Home page loads, straight away you see the OctoMuyThai name straight away clear at the top of the page making you aware of the name of the gym. Then further down the Home Page there is bold welcome message outlining we provide Muy Thai training at the gym in the South London area thus allowing visitors to know the name of the gym and what we offer as soon as possible.
4. As a site user, I want to know why I should join this gym.
* As you scroll down the Home page, you see the three pictures with the headings: Fitter, Faster and Stronger. These headings with the associated pictures and content stating what can be achieved if you train at OctoMuyThai gym consistently provides three very clear reasons to join the gym.
5. As a site user, I want to be able to see any Muy Thai techniques I'm interested in learning.
* I load the Home page and click on the Techniques heading in the header navigation, once the Techniques page loads I see the headings of the various techniques with the Youtube videos underneath and short explanation under the videos. I click on the play button on the video and it starts to play the tutorial. I click on each of the six videos to ensure it plays appropriately. On my iPhone using the Safari browser as I select the video it automatically plays in full screen which gives a good user experience as they can see the video in the biggest size possible giving the small size of the mobile screen.
6. As a site user, I want to know the timing of the classes at the gym.
* As the Home page loads, I click on the Timetable heading in the navigation bar in the header. On the right of the page, it lists each day of the week and whether there is a class on that day with the time that the class starts. When I load the page on mobile, the picture comes first with the timetable listed below.
7. As a site user, I want to know the price of membership at the gym.
* As the Home page loads, I click on the Timetable heading in the navigation bar in the header. As you scroll down the page you see that the price of membership on a monthly basis is £79 with one-off classes £10. When I load the page on mobile, the picture comes first with the timetable and then the prices listed below for membership and one-off classes.
8. As a site user, I want to be able to join the gym.
* As the Home page loads, I click on the Sign Up heading in the navigation bar in the header. As the Sign Up page loads I see the sign up form on the right under the heading Come and Train With Us. There is a field to be filled out for name, email address, first line of address, town or city and postcode. Once filled out you can then click on the Join Now button and join the gym. If you click the Join Now button without filling out a field then you get a message saying "Please fill this field".
9. As an owner of the site, I want visitors to the site to be able to join the gym.
* As the Home page loads, I click on the Sign Up heading in the navigation bar in the header. As the Sign Up page loads I see the sign up form on the right under the heading Come and Train With Us. There is a field to be filled out for name, email address, first line of address, town or city and postcode. Once filled out you can then click on the Join Now button and join the gym. If you click the Join Now button without filling out a field then you get a message saying "Please fill this field".
10. As a site user, I want to find directions to get to the gym.
* As the Home page loads, I select the Sign Up heading in the header navigation bar. This loads the Sign Up page and there on the left I can see the heading Where To Find Us which has a picture of a map and written directions and therefore I'm able to locate the gym. On the mobile the heading Where To Find Us is directly under the header navigation bars along with the picture of the map and directions.

## Interactive Testing
* Tested the interaction that hovering over the main gym title highlights it a gold colour - [see screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99667611-8d42e600-2a64-11eb-8f5b-82ff6a5eba3f.png).

* Tested the interaction that hovering over the social media links highlights it a gold colour and enlarges it - [see Facebook icon screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99667855-e27ef780-2a64-11eb-8f03-f77336a615d8.png), [see Instagram icon screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99667812-d004be00-2a64-11eb-9318-6f6d75af84f0.png), [see Twitter icon screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99667964-04787a00-2a65-11eb-9773-bd42a507e485.png) and [see Youtube icon screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99668089-2ffb6480-2a65-11eb-9420-2eb8d7a93e54.png).
* Tested the interaction that hovering over the navigation items in the header produces a float shadow effect and inverse the colour changing text from white to blue and background from blue to white - [see Home navigation screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99668166-46a1bb80-2a65-11eb-902b-b6d2ddb5e7eb.png), [see Techniques navigation screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99668244-63d68a00-2a65-11eb-999f-da5a68b184c8.png), [see Timetable navigation screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99668331-7bae0e00-2a65-11eb-8043-eafbc6ea3024.png) and [see Sign Up navigation screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99668435-a0a28100-2a65-11eb-8e6b-9b6f3f626baf.png).
* Tested the same interaction as above for the navigation items in the footer - [see Home navigation screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99668575-d8a9c400-2a65-11eb-87a6-eee3dda6465d.png), [see Techniques navigation screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99668620-e65f4980-2a65-11eb-9d26-137e89f34c68.png), [see Timetable navigation screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99668940-46ee8680-2a66-11eb-9a40-3c8952c5286f.png) and [see Sign Up navigation screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99669145-8f0da900-2a66-11eb-92ae-c680652b9a8b.png).
* Tested the interaction that hovering over the Join Now button in the Sign Up page makes the button uppercase and changes the background to white and the text to blue - [see screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46917417/99704971-048e6f00-2a91-11eb-8739-d537099c1197.png)

## Further Testing
* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox.
* The Website was tested on laptop, Iphone and Samsung Galaxy S8.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure all links across pages are working correctly.
* A friend, who is a fullstack developer, was asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs or user experience issues.

## Fixed Bugs/Issues
* I had an issue whereby the rows under the main heading row were sticking out making the website look uneven. I finally figured out is that those other rows in the header required the Bootstrap class "no-gutters" as well as the row where the main title was on.
* There was issue with images being used as backgrounds for various divs and as a result being cut-off in an unaesthetic way. I re-sized the images and amended the margins in the content to ensure the background images now show in a more aesthetic way.
* I had an issue centering the logo image and resolved this by using the class in the col div and giving it text-align: center to ensure that anything placed within it is centered i.e. the logo image.
* While testing the Website on Iphone using the Safari browser saw that my map picture on the sign up page was sticking out to the right of everything else on the page. I removed the margin-left styling from the css and instead used a width styling of 100% to resolve this.
* I experienced an issue with the footer navigation bar where the items got squahsed together at smaller screen sizes so I amended the media query so that the footer navigation bar disappears at a slightly bigger screen size.

## Known Bugs/Issues
* Using Lighthouse report found that performance is only rated a 69. Main issue appears to be file size of pictures so given more time would attempt to save the files in a different file format which could reduce the file size.
